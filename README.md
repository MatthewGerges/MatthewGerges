As a mechatronics student at the University of Waterloo, I bring a unique combination of technical skills and hands-on experience to the table. With a background in software development, I am comfortable creating and deploying mobile applications using frameworks like Flutter and Firebase. I have experience in both professional and personal settings, including working at a startup called VCycene where I specialized in the creation of composting machines.

In addition to my software skills, I have experience in PCB design, using tools like Altium Circuitmaker and KiCad to create schematics, lay out parts, and send them to manufacturing. I have experience in mechanical design as well, using software like Fusion360 and Solidworks to create a wide range of personal gadgets and tools.

I am also proficient in Python and have experience with AI chatbots and image segmentation tools. My passion for technology has driven me to explore new and innovative ways to bring my ideas to life. I am a quick learner and enjoy tackling new challenges, whether it is working with an Arduino or incorporating multithreading and FreeRTOS in IoT projects with ESP32.

I am highly motivated to use my skills to solve global problems and improve the quality or efficiency of people's lives. With my passion for technology, ability to learn quickly and wide range of experiences in both software and hardware development, I am confident in my ability to make significant contributions to any team or project.
